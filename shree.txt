What is the overall flow of the backend? (VERY IMPORTANT)

Here is EXACTLY how your full backend works:

React ➜ Axios ➜ Express API ➜ Controllers ➜ Models ➜ MongoDB
                       |
                       ⬇
                     JWT

User Signup:

React → API /signup → Controller → User Model → MongoDB

User Login:

React → API /login → Controller → JWT token returned

Task CRUD:

React → API → Token verified → Controller → Task Model → MongoDB



FOR INTERVIEW
⭐ WHAT YOU HAVE COMPLETED SO FAR

These are VERY important topics for your interview:

✔ Express setup
✔ MongoDB connection
✔ Environment variables
✔ bcrypt password hashing
✔ JWT token generation
✔ Signup API
✔ Login API
✔ Clean folder structure
✔ Debugging + fixing routing issues
✔ Understanding security + IP whitelisting

This alone is enough to impress interviewers.

NOW — BEGINNER-FRIENDLY & INTERVIEW-FRIENDLY EXPLANATION

You must understand this perfectly because interviewers LOVE asking:

📌 “How does JWT authentication work?”
📌 “What is a middleware in Express?”
📌 “How do you protect routes?”

Let’s explain your code step by step.

⭐ 1. What is Middleware?

In Express, middleware is a function that:

✔ Runs before the actual route/controller
✔ Can modify req and res
✔ Decides whether the user is allowed to continue

Example of flow:

Request → Middleware → Controller → Response


Your Auth Middleware sits in the middle and protects routes.

⭐ 2. Why do we need JWT Authentication?

After login:

→ Backend gives user a token
→ User includes token with every request
→ Backend uses middleware to verify it
→ Only then user can access protected APIs

This is how apps keep users logged in securely.
